The best thing about being a nerd mommy is raising a nerd son. Among other things that are full of awesome are the great conversations we get to have.

This morning when we were driving to school, he interrupted the silence.

"Mommy, I got a question."

"Okay, what's on your mind?"

"What's stronger, a trident or a sword?"

"Hmm. That's a good question. The trident is sort of in the same weapons class as a polearm, and it's a two-handed weapon. So I'd have to know if the sword was a regular sword, which uses one hand, or a great sword, which is a two-handed weapon like the trident. Generally I would say that a sword with a shield would be better, because warrior/melee classes use those and can usually defeat the type of classesÂ - like dragoons in Final Fantasy - that use tridents or polearms."

"Well, I would think the trident would be stronger because it could pierce the shield."

"It depends- shields are usually made to withstand a trident though."

"Hmm. What if you had a trident and then two swords on your back, and then pulled out your two swords and put your trident on your back?"

"Well, then you'd be badass."

He smiled, the kind of smile that is completely priceless.
