I meant to not only understand how to properly/semantically use the header and footer elements but to actually use them that way.

I meant to not like Bootstrap so much.

I meant to be able to write JavaScript on demand and in front of people and not feel like a daft idiot who can't remember anything.

I meant to not get excited about a 4s page load time because 2s is better.

I meant to do better, but I didn't.
