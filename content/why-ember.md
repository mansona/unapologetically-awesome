I hear this question enough that I want to put some coherent thoughts together on it. There are so many reasons I like it, but it's really the result of 20-ish years of experiences so my answer ends up feeling too big and most of the time I think, "<em>because, obviously</em>." I realize this doesn't really work for my outside voice, though, so I'm going to try to clarify.

Over the lifetime of many projects, I found myself doing some things over and over:
<ul>
 	<li>setting up project file scaffolding</li>
 	<li>figuring out a testing strategy</li>
 	<li>integrating a design language</li>
 	<li>routing</li>
 	<li>hours in meetings, talking over every one of these things in painful detail</li>
 	<li>finding out that a dude on the project decided to "rewrite everything last night" and spending weeks trying to work through that</li>
 	<li>debugging everyone's code to figure out which engineer's "style of doing things" was making everyone else's stuff break</li>
 	<li>writing tons of project maintainer documentation (only to have it become obsolete when the new guy on the team convinced management we needed to greenfield the project entirely)</li>
</ul>
Before Ember, I was convinced that the way things were was just the way the world of web development/application engineering worked, and there was nothing to be done about it. I could leave, of course, but I didn't want to. I love to write code! Plus I'm a little stubborn- most of my life has been doing things that people have told me I can't/couldn't do. So I stuck it out.

I came to understand that at its most basic, my desire was that my code reflected the person I was on the inside, really- some things about me have changed over time, but I can be counted on. I am determined, I am reliable, and I have grit. I can bend but not break. I keep in mind what I could be, but still want to love what I already am.

When I started to use Ember, it was at first just a "<em>oh that's convenient.</em>" When I went looking for things, they were in the place where it made sense that they would be. When I thought, "<em>I wonder if Ember does that?</em>" I was delighted to discover that it (mostly) did!

Here are some of the things that Ember provides that I value:
<ol>
 	<li>a way to escape the endless bike-shedding of non-essential details</li>
 	<li>a command line tool that gives me what I need to move forward, quickly</li>
 	<li>a path forward to embrace new things</li>
 	<li>a way to be successful today, and dive deeper when <em>I'm</em> ready</li>
</ol>
Ember seemed to just get that for the day-to-day of shipping business value, there were parts of the development experience that could be standardized in such a way so as to have minimal overhead on spinning up a new project. The first time I typed <code>'ember new my-app'</code> into the command line, a huge smile spread across my face when I looked in my code editor and the project scaffolding had magically appeared. As I looked through it, it all seemed purposeful. Better yet? It's where I would have wanted most things to go. <em>I cannot describe the feeling of knowing that I was about to get to opt out of the "where Steve thinks this directory should be nested" conversation <strong>for the rest of my life</strong>.</em> Exhilarating. A burden was lifted.

The exhilaration grew as I got to know about <a href="https://guides.emberjs.com/release/templates/handlebars-basics/">templates</a>- <em>handlebars just make sense to me! and they're useful! and oh my god look at this, there are already useful helpers! Then into <a href="https://guides.emberjs.com/release/routing/">routing</a>, what a sensible approach! This also makes sense! Oh my god, this testing story! It's here! It's all here! All the things I need are here!</em>

I'm a few years in and the exhilaration hasn't gone away.  Behind the very sensible approach to developing web apps, I also found an incredible community. A community that will teach you how to do things that you don't know how to do yet. A community that <a href="http://emberwomen.com/">supports women in tech</a>. A <a href="https://www.emberjs.com/community/">community</a> that uses these shared standards to <a href="http://emberobserver.com">create addons</a> to contribute to an even richer experience. An incredible <a href="https://emberconf.com/">annual conference</a>. <a href="https://www.emberjs.com/learn/">Learning resources</a> and community-produced <a href="https://balinterdi.com/rock-and-roll-with-emberjs/">tutorials</a>, <a href="https://embermap.com/">videos</a> and even <a href="https://medium.com/ember-ish">complementary blogs</a> that build on one another. And if you have an idea for how something that already exists could be improved, or for something new that doesn't exist yet, there's an <a href="https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs">RFC process</a>.

I could keep going on and on- and maybe I will, some other time. I hope this is enough of a story to intrigue you, dear reader, to come see what this gem is all about.

It might just be an escape from the churn that you've been looking for!
