Sometimes, you get to make it better. Those are the good days.

Here's the before and after of a site re-design I just finished at work. I was able to implementÂ Bootstrap 3.2 on Blackbaud's content management system, BBIS. While I know there is inevitable polish to be applied, this site has been bugging me for the last year and a half and it was immensely satisfying to finish the work and have it approved for production!

Yes, they're screenshots on my own mobile device (iPhone 5S), but the site was examined across most platforms(I say most because I still haven't found a Blackberry device for testing).
