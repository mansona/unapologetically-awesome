My tips for a successful site redesign (especially in a higher-education setting):
<ol>
	<li>Let Google Analytics be your guide. Look at what pages people currently actually use.</li>
	<li>Get your stakeholders to give you a site goal- who is the audience? What is the purpose of the website? Administrators can forget that a website is NOT a repository for all of their knowledge but should instead be focused on a specific task.</li>
	<li>Determine 8-10 “tasks” for A/B testing and ask a random study group to participate to complete that short list of tasks. Examples of question types from past studies I’ve done:
<ol>
	<li>Who do I contact about X?</li>
	<li>Where would I find the date to apply/register for X?</li>
	<li>Who is the chair of the department? How did you find their web page?</li>
	<li>What services do we offer?</li>
	<li>What’s the best way to contact the administrative support team?</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
I will carefully and emphatically repeat: your website is NOT the appropriate place to place every bit of knowledge you have.
