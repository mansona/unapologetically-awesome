I signed up to try out OpenShift after reading "Getting Started with OpenShift" and attending All Things Open.

Honestly, the hardest part of making an app has been figuring out what to name it.

I'm really stunned at how simple it is - today I made an app with Node, MongoDB and even went to the OpenShift marketplace and found SendGrid (email delivery) as an add-on product.

When did it become so simple to create apps? I feel a little stunned, mostly because everything I know I've taught myself, and it's been a long process to learn it all along the way. It's been harder than this. Way harder than this, but now all of the sudden it's not quite so hard.

The thing about learning to be a full-stack developer, is that you learn to have this constant worry about the server settings. Mostly it's that nagging feeling, that "wait, did I miss something? What if there's a server setting that I didn't know existed, much less how to configure, and what if it's a huge security issue and all the things will fail and it will be all my fault and...." and then I don't get any sleep for the next few weeks, until nothing does get hacked and that nervous tummy feeling at least subsides a little, even if it never fully goes away.

OpenShift seems to change all of that.

There are constraints, of course, but I find myself being a little braver in these last few days, a little less worried about developing an app that will bring down the proverbial Kingdom. I'm still paranoid, but there seems to be a lot more room to let my imagination do some exploring, and it's definitely a feeling I could get used to.
