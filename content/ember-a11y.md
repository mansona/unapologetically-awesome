Working with Ember has been rewarding. Working on accessibility in Ember has been even more rewarding.

The Ember community's commitment to diversity and inclusion goes beyond just some nice key phrases. I've witnessed the kind of accountability I wish I saw all over the world. Until equality is really here, we need to be able to have conversations that address specific issues, and seeing the "straight white male" speaking up/out/against undesired behavior has been fantastic to witness. I am blessed to be a part of this community.

I was invited to get involved with the ember-a11y project, and I couldn't be more satisfied. Well okay, maybe my satisfaction levels will rise when I can contribute more of the heavy lifting, but for now I am happy to coordinate and write code samples. There are a lot of great places to get involved though- why not check it out? <a href="https://github.com/ember-a11y">https://github.com/ember-a11y </a> is the link. Definitely worth it!
