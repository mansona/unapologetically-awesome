I thought about it. Importing years of WordPress blog entries. They tell you to do that, and I can sort of understand why. Who wants to start all over? I'm on my second career, and I can tell you from personal experience that starting over mostly sucks.

In the end, though, I couldn't do it. Reading through all those posts, I realized that was a different journey, and it was okay that it ended, and this one is beginning.

I write code now. Lots of it. Not always fun code - sometimes it's HTML email code, and anyone who writes code can tell you that it's the worst sort of code to be asked to write. But it's mostly really fun. It energizes me! It's exhilarating and I get to be a creative problem solver. Totally full of win.
