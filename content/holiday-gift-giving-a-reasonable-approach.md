<p>Holiday gift guides can be a little weird. Either the gifts are useless, or pricey, or useless and pricey. I think I can do a little better, so I'm going to try. </p>

<p>I haven't gotten paid to advertise or endorse any of these things. I just like them.&nbsp; I think they'd all work pretty well for friends or family or even just for yourself!&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li><a href="https://www.uncommongoods.com/product/game-of-phones">Game of Phones ($20.00)</a> This is just really fun, and we all have phones!</li><li><a href="https://www.ulta.com/theyre-real-push-up-gel-eyeliner-pen?productId=xlsImpprod10421039">Benefit Cosmetics They're Real Push Up Liner Gel Eyeliner Pen in Black </a>($24) Only the black one is any good, even though they make other colors. I think it's a different formula. The black is amazing though. Stays.put. Period. You can find this at Ulta, Amazon &amp; other places, so pick your fav spot and look for it there!</li><li><a href="https://www.lushusa.com/bath/bath-bombs/">Lush Bath Bombs</a> ($4.95-7.95 ea) - Especially try the <a href="https://www.lushusa.com/bath/bath-bombs/butterball/00012.html">Butterball</a> if you've not had this experience yet. They even have <a href="https://www.lushusa.com/gifts/">a gifts section</a>, with different wrapped options to try.&nbsp;</li><li>Anyone who has seen my extensive collection from JetPens knows what a big fan I am. They have <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/gifts">an awesome gift guide</a>, too! Here are my favorite items from JetPens:<ol><li><a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Monami-Essenti-Stick-Dry-Highlighter-Bright-5-Color-Set/pd/14282">Monami Essenti Strick Dry Highlighter</a> ($6.00)</li><li><a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Staedtler-Lumocolor-Correctable-Dry-Erase-Pen-Fine-Point-4-Color-Set/pd/12230">Staedtler Lumocolor Correctable Dry Erase Pen - Fine Point - 4 Color Set</a> ($10.50) - you can use these on paper OR dry erase surfaces, they have a built-in eraser, and the fine point is REALLY a fine point!&nbsp;</li><li><a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Zebra-Fortia-300-Ballpoint-Pen-0.7-mm-Blue-Body/pd/11107">Zebra&nbsp;Fortia 300 Ballpoint Pen - 0.7 mm</a> ($4.95) - I am not typically a fan of something so large as a 0.7mm, but this one is an exception. I have also given away more of these pens than I have purchased for myself, because everyone who tries it absolutely loves it. And when paired with the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Maruman-Mnemosyne-N183A-Inspiration-Notebook-A5-Unruled/pd/4079">Maruman Mnemosyne Inspiration Notebook</a> ($9.75).... :heart-eyes:&nbsp;</li><li><a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Sun-Star-Delde-Slide-Pen-Pouch-Natural-Black/pd/15623">Sun-Star Delde Slide Pen Pouch</a> ($14.50) It's super useful because it stands up and doubles as a pen holder on your desk. I also attach enamel pins to it, and it's sturdy enough to handle it.&nbsp;</li></ol></li><li><a href="https://www.nordstromrack.com/shop/product/1349013">A Barefoot Dreams throw</a> ($49.97) - available at Nordstrom Rack right now- definitely worth it (they're usually $100-150!!!). Snag one while you can! I will also guarantee that whomever you gift this to will adore you forever.&nbsp;</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Magical-Rainbow-Dabbing-Unicorn-Hoodie/dp/B0776QVKNY">A dabbing unicorn hoodie</a> ($12+, depending) because we all know someone who would love this for whatever reason.&nbsp;</li><li>A <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0187UINJE/">box of 24 mini Tabasco sauce bottles</a> ($18ish) for that person in your life who needs the heat in their life. Always. No matter where they are.&nbsp;</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Making-Ideas-Happen-Overcoming-Obstacles/dp/1591844118/">Making Ideas Happen</a> ($14) by Scott Belsky. This is my favorite book of all time and the one I credit the most for me being who I am today. I have given this gift en-masse at holiday time, and continue to send copies when I meet someone who needs this book. I can't recommend it highly enough.&nbsp;</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0796DR2XV/">An Absolutely Remarkable Thing</a> ($15) by Hank Green, John Green's younger brother and one half of the Vlogbrothers. They run <a href="https://store.dftba.com/">DFTBA</a> (don't forget to be awesome) and An Absolutely Remarkable Thing even has <a href="https://store.dftba.com/collections/an-absolutely-remarkable-thing-official-merch">extra merch</a> - which you'll want all of after you read the story. It's fun, relevant to NOW, and just a really good story.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><a href="https://www.target.com/p/lego-174-ideas-women-of-nasa-21312/-/A-52946275">LEGO® Ideas Women of NASA 21312</a> ($20) - Support this because more of this just needs to exist!!&nbsp;</li></ol>

This one takes a little more planning, and a little storage space, so it's not for everyone- but it is <em>really</em> fun to do!&nbsp;</p>
